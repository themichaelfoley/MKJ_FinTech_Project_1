## A First Look- Alcohol Stocks vs. Cannabis Stocks

### Abstract 
The purpose of our first project is to compare data of an established market with an emerging market to see how they each differentiate and what would ultimately be a superior investment. By evaluating these variables and their data, we were able to determine the risk of each investment and what would generate more revenue. As a final juxtaposition, we compare both our data frames (Alcohol and Cannabis) to the S&P 500 to show how they both perform against a larger portfolio. 

### What Stocks Did We Choose? 
We choose to work with Alcohol Stocks which is an established market and Cannabis Stocks which is an emerging market as legalization continues to allow more access. Our group was intrigued on how these two stocks would compare specially with outliers like the pandemic and legalization become more widespread. We were also interested in the level of risk each investment would pose due to the differences between both industries.  

### Expected Results and Trouble
As legalization became more extensive over the past few years, we had high hopes that the Cannabis Stocks would outperform Alcohol Stocks when we began researching our data. However, we quickly realized that since Cannabis is a relatively new industry, there are not many companies that have extensive stock data for usage. Originally, we planned on comparing these industries by top 5 by marketcap over the past 5 years, however we had to narrow our data and change our stocks to get enough for comparison. Consequently, this allowed us to focus and compare our data before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic which was really interesting to see. 

### Data Processing and Results
We used 5 different stocks for each market totaling 10 stocks for our entire portfolio.  An API call was used as the primary source of gathering necessary data which was pickled for proper storage. Data was cleaned and reorganized which was used to compute Weighted Returns, Cumulative Returns, Sharpe Ratios, and Rolling Beta. We also utilized the S&P 500 API to compare how our combined stocks for each market performed against a more substantial denominator. Our Benchmark ultimately proved Cannabis to be a risky investment mostly due to how relatively new this market is.
